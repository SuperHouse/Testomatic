Testomatic To Do
================

 * Silkscreen on XT60 footprint.
 * Reverse protection diode on VIN. Mitchell says full bridge rectifier. Which is ridiculous. But also awesome.
 * Increase thermal relief widths on edge connector GND pins and XT60 connector.
 * Length-match USB traces.
 * Add solder wicking area beside USB mechanical holes
 * Add bolt holes to XT60 footprint for panel mount version of connector (maybe)
